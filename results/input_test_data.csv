You can make it work for books quite well, examinkng the thoughts going through each fighter's head with each action, but in more visual media like movies or shows, that flexibility of time to draw out a short fight through mind games and such is a lot harder to pull off"", 'I think people misunderstand sci fi lasers.

They have their own stretches on physics but they paid a great deal more attention to details than pretty much any other show or movie.', ""i think all of this is why the warp/jump/wormhole drive or whatever is such a magical piece of sci-fi gear. it not only makes travel over long distance feasible in a meaningful time period, but it would also make it impossible to observe someone move towards you, as the target would be moving at the speed of light (or faster). you literally wouldn't be able to attack or prepare defenses until they drop out of warp on you, making space a highly agressive battlefield.\ni really like how the older elite games handled warp. it was only usable between systems, but still tooks years to do. additionally, jumping between systems left a visible wake from where you entered hyperspace, and a ship with faster warp could analyze your warp wake, outspeed you to your destination, and literally just wait for you to arrive and kill you. that was a take i found really interesting on space combat."", '10:34 We couldn’t even detect a 17-20 meter diameter meteor weighing 10k metric tons in 2013 until it exploded over Russia. .What’s the basis for saying we can currently track a spaceship smaller than a house and weighing considerably less than 10k metric tons?

This is just a small town example, so I can only imagine what the top guys are up to on a daily basis.\n\n\nEdit for the people asking: During my time in Korea, I worked at 2 different Hagwons. The first was in a small town (of about 100,000, by Korean standards that is small) that I highly doubt anyone here would know by name, most Koreans  I talk to about it don\'t know about it. The second was at a major Hagwon in Seoul in the rich part of town, called Gangnam.

At first, we would just chat in the lobby waiting for his brother. But over time we started hanging out outside of the school. Mostly because he wanted a foreigner friend to practice his English with, since he started going overseas often because of his new role at Samsung.

When the US Military deploys entire batallions or brigades of troops from one continent to another, they do so by chartering entire 777 or other dreamliner class trans-oceanic flights. The method is back to front, every second isle, but with a twist. You load back to front, no choice of which seat, and you do not stowe your bag immediatly. You sit down in the seat with your bag in your lap and wait. Once the row has filled and the row in front has filled, all bags are passed to the isle seat, who shoves them all into the overhead bins one by one for the entire row. While you are sitting down with your bag in your lap, you have a couple moments to pull out whatever items you will immediatly need and prep your bag to be stowed. I do not know if the method has a specific name, but I experienced it on three separate occations going to or from deployments. This seating method basicly reduces all stopages from stowing bags and from seat shuffling to nearly zero.\n\nThis however would basicaly never work for a civillian flight for many reasons. People traveling together and trust being the major issues. General travelers will likely not trust in handing their bag of personal belongings to a random stranger to have them stuff it into the overhead, and the random isle-seat passenger will probably not be willing to do the extra work of putting 5-7 bags into he overhead one after another. (As I said, trans-pacific flights, where it's two isles and 7-8 seats in the middle row and 4-5 in each side row, and sometimes even an upstairs and downstairs.) People traveling in groups would want to all sit together, and this seating method has basicly zero promise that they will even be in the same row, as by the time they get to their seats, the group might be split between two entirly different sections.\n\nSo while this seating method is highly efficent, it can basicly only occur when every single person involved is on the same page, knows the plan, and is basicly ordered 'this is how this is going to happen so just shut up and do it because it's not up for debate'\nEdit : It's also one of the only times when every single person on the plane has at least one firearm, but they have all taken the bolt out and put it in their pocket, and nobody has any ammo."", 'Shout out to the guys who only bring 1 bag and literally sit in their seat and then slide the backpack under their seat.

27,pGjVAvJWkG4,"{'Comments': ['For anyone that\'s a bit confused on the premise of the video, especially in the latter half, orcas have what are called ""ecotypes"". Essentially, orcas have many different lifestyles and live in many different places, with their own cultures and traditions. Orcas don\'t just eat and hunt everything like what would be implied as them being top predators of the sea. Orcas are taught by their families what food is, and this can mean particular things for particular groups. Some only eat fish, some only eat marine mammals, some only eat sharks. Some are more general. It all depends.\n\nThe main character orca\'s ecotype are the ""Resident"" Orcas of the North Pacific. It\'s particularly a reference to those that live off the coast of British Columbia, who are the most studied orcas in the world. The ecotype he meets near the end with the elephant seals are North Pacific\'s ""Transient"" (or Bigg\'s) Orcas, which hunt marine mammals. The two groups largely avoid each other due to cultural, language, and evolutionary difference.\n\nThe ones he meets off of Norway are two different groups of ""Type 1"" Atlantic Orcas, which themselves are divided into 7 different groups. He references the ones that eat marine mammals and the ones that eat herring. Yes they are different groups that eat different things.\n\nThe pair of orcas he meets down in South Africa are a pair of individuals known as ""Port"" and ""Starboard"", which are a pair of orcas that have become famous for hunting Great Whites. While specific orca ecotypes do eat sharks and rays, hunting great whites is pretty rare and only really seen as a particular quirk with certain orcas that have learned how to do it, hence why these two are so famous. They also have floppy dorsal fins. Despite the overarching myth of floppy fins being a sign of bad health, we still don\'t really know why it happens, or why those two wild orcas have it.\n\nAntarctica has its own subset of orcas, with at least 5 different ecotypes identified (A, B1, B2, C, and D). Type A orcas hunt minke whales, with both types of B Orcas hunting seals and penguins as seen in the video. By contrast, Type Cs only eat antarctic cod. Type D is extremely mysterious, only sighted a handful of times throughout history, and don\'t really look like any other orca group with their ""squinting"" eyespots and very bulbous heads.\n\nThere is also a (currently little understood) ecotype of orcas off the coast of Argentina that hunt sea lions by jumping out onto the beach after them. This is a learned behavior that takes skill, because it is very dangerous. They can\'t just do it innately because, as you can imagine, it could easily get them killed. \n\nThere is debate on whether of these orca ecotypes are all the same species or not. There\'s a lot of similarities AND differences in terms of physical appearance, with a lot of groups seemingly being very distinct evolutionarily (some ecotypes are separated by a few MILLION years, which is pretty long on a species-level). I personally find it likely that orcas are ""overlumped"" as it were. There\'s likely multiple subspecies or even species of orca entirely. There\'s been heavy research and debate about it in recent years. However, the truth is that we have a lot to learn about orcas before we can figure all that out. Orcas are actually incredibly mysterious animals despite their popularity, and outside of particular groups like our orca\'s Resident ecotype, they are usually understudied. Orcas themselves are almost like their own group of people under the ocean, with their own history and culture that we\'re only recently just been starting to unravel.

The Grouper, the Clownfish, the Electric eel, and many others all were originally in the script but I cut them because I've already featured them in other videos and didn't want to just repeat stuff. But please do go check out other videos on my channel to find them! My video about team combos is a good place to start.\n\n2: The cat that gets attacked during the Pike section is fine, if you slow down the video you can see that it just gets smacked on the nose and pushed back. It didn't actually get grabbed and pulled into the water.\n\n3: I didn't notice how funny the clip with the piranha being eaten by the caiman was while I was purchasing the stock footage, but wow, what a clip.\n\n4: This video is really popping off, so I really want to emphasize how grateful I am that I get to make these videos.

Since they\'re invasive, local fish haven\'t adapted to the lionfish\'s hunting strategies or defenses. Pair this with a voracious appetite and watch as lionfish kill or outcompete just about every other local fish population into extinction.\nThere\'s good news though. Scientists have found that local predators can be ""taught"" to recognize lionfish as food by leaving dead or wounded ones in the water.
